-  Hi, I’m @Andrew-Skivington
-  I’m interested in machine learning and its applicatoins to modern physics research.
- I’m currently an A3D3 Post-baccalaureate fellow learning how to interface with FPGAs and run real-time ML algorithms on them. These devices and algorithms are used at detectors at CERN, specifically in the CMS experiment.
