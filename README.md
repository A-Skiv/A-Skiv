-  Hi, I’m Andrew Skivington,
-  I’m interested in machine learning and its applicatoins to modern physics research.
- I’m currently an A3D3 Post-baccalaureate fellow beginning to learn how to interface with FPGAs and run fast ML algorithms on them. These devices and algorithms are incorpated in particle detectors at CERN, specifically in the CMS experiment to analyze astronomical amounts of collision events, which ultimately speeds up the rate of scientific discovery!
